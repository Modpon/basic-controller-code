It's Perfect if you have a hydroponic or aquaponic system. Control different systems using drip, ebb- flow or NFT for example.\r\nThere are 3 knobs to change the pump power, run time and off time. The timing and pump power is visible on the Oled screen together with some sensor data (optional).\r\n\r\nThe Arduino code works but it needs some cleaning.\r\n\r\nWe are also planning to integrate the water temperature, EC and PH sensors.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
