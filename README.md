Arduino code for the basic controller

The basic controller utilizes a Arduino nano to control pumps, lights or other 12v devices and read sensors. It's Perfect if you have a hydroponic or aquaponic system. Control different systems using drip, ebb- flow or NFT for example.
There are 3 knobs to change the pump power, run time and off time. The timing and pump power is visible on the Oled screen together with some sensor data (optional).

The Arduino code works but it needs some cleaning.

We are also planning to integrate the water temperature, EC and PH sensors.
